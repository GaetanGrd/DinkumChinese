Generic/14 NPC_Ghost_Intro_003_193092	I heard that you're the one thats been working hard to get this town set up?

Generic/13 NPC_Villager3_Intro_003_193094	I heard that you're the one thats been working hard to get this town set up?
Generic/13 NPC_Villager3_Intro_004_193094	Well, thanks for that, <PlayerName>! <glee>
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_000_194602	Looks like we've landed!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_001_194602	<glee>þI'll tell you what, I’m so glad you’ve decided to accompany me on this adventure, <PlayerName>.
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_002_194602	<worried>þI was starting to think no one in <SouthCity> was brave enough to join me!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_003_194602	<haha>When you were the first and only person to respond to my ad, I knew you were the right person for the job!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_004_194602	<no>Oh dear, look at old <myName> waffle on...
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_005_194602	Let's get cracking, <PlayerName>!
Generic/SpecialIntro_Intro_006_194602	I'll see you outside, okay?
Generic/Completed_Intro_000_194802	Oh, <PlayerName>!
Generic/Completed_Intro_001_194802	<IslandName> is growing very nicely.
Generic/Completed_Intro_002_194802	With our current population, <SouthCity> has offically recognised <IslandName> as a settlement.
Generic/Completed_Intro_003_194802	That means we can upgrade the base tent into a real Town Hall.
Generic/Completed_Intro_004_194802	<proud>I'll tell you what, I'll cover the costs myself.
Generic/Completed_Intro_005_194802	If I could ask you to gather items required for the Town Hall.
Generic/Completed_Intro_006_194802	<yes>I've put a Deposit Box out the front of the Base Tent.
Generic/Completed_Intro_007_194802	<shy>I'll tell you what, you've really changed my life for the better, <PlayerName>.
Generic/Completed_Intro_008_194802	<yes>Infact, everyone here on <IslandName> owes it all to you!
Generic/Completed_Intro_009_194802	<yes>It's not much, but we wanted to get you a gift.
Generic/Completed_Intro_010_194802	<yes>Think of it as a symbol of gratitude from everyone here on <IslandName>.
Npc9/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_000_194996	Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!
Npc9/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_001_194996	<getPhotoDetails>
Npc9/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_002_194996	I'm quite fond of it to be honest! <haha>
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_000_195260	Oh, <PlayerName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_001_195260	<glee>I, like, have a gift for you.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_002_195260	It's my <itemName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_003_195260	<shy>I've been adding information to it, like, my whole life.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_004_195260	<thinking>You could probably use it to get some infomation on any plants you are growing.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_005_195260	<yes>Oh, don't worry about me, I think you'll, like, get more use out of it to be honest.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_006_195260	<haha>Anyway, I've got all the info up here!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195262	I’m very impressed with the work you’ve done here today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195262	<proud>I think there is a great future for us all here at <IslandName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195262	<shy>Here is a gift for helping me out so much.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195262	It's a <itemName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195262	I think you should take the rest of the day off.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_195262	Maybe you could go catch some of the bugs around here?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_195262	Or maybe you could cook some of that fruit you found?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_000_195262	I'll figure out something to do...
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_195262	I'm ready for bed!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_195262	<haha>I’m sure you will! 
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_195262	Oh and before I forget, take this <itemName> too.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_195262	When you get tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_195262	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_195262	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_195262	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_195262	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_195262	<haha>I'm tired too!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_001_195262	Here, take this <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_002_195262	If you are tired, pop that on the ground and have a lay down.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_003_195262	<haha>I'll tell you what, a good nights rest will do us both good!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_004_195262	Thanks for your help today, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_005_195262	I can't believe we're on <IslandName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_006_195262	<glee>I couldn't have done any of this without you!
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195264	<PlayerName>, I've been contacted by some of the people back in <SouthCity>.
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195264	<no>I've been notified that we will need 5 permanent residents before <IslandName> is recognised as an official settlement.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195264	Now, there is no hurry, but maybe that should be our next goal?
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195264	<haha>I'll tell you what, any visitors that see how nice <IslandName> is will want to stay anyway!
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_195264	Once <SouthCity> recognises <IslandName> as an official settlement, we can build a Town Hall!
Generic/Intro_Intro_005_195264	<glee>I'm sure we'll reach our goal soon!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195266	I’ve got another job for you! You up for it?þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_000_195266	I'm ready!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_195266	Not yet.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_195266	If we are going to build anything around here we’re going to need materials.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_195266	I reckon we need to wood and Tin. þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_195266	Now, wood? That’s easy. You chop down a tree and then you’ve got some wood.þ <yes>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_195266	But Tin? That’s a bit trickier. I’ve seen it around the island poking out of rocks here and there. It’s a dark ore. You’ll know it if you see it.<yes>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_195266	Now, we’re going to need to smelt it down into bars before we can use the Tin Ore for building things. <thinking>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_195266	Go give the island a bit of a looky-loo for <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_195266	Bring them back here and I'll show you how we can turn Tin Ore into bars. <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_195266	Righto then.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_001_195266	Come see me soon, okay?
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195268	Oh <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195268	Our town is really growing!
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195268	Someone has let me know they are interesting in living here.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195268	There is a new deed for a home avaliable. <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_195268	Once their home is build I'm sure they will move in! <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195270	As you know, we’ve been tasked with starting a new settlement on this island.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195270	I know you’ve just arrived but I’m going to need your help right away!þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195270	The first thing we need to do is set up a base camp.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195270	Take this <itemName>. This will be our base of operations as it were. We will be building the settlement out from there.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195270	Please take your time to look around the island before deciding where to start our new settlement.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_195270	Once you have found a suitable place,  you will need to clear out the land to place the <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_195270	I’ll give you some tools that I’ve brought with me. These should be enough to clear some space to set up the <itemName>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_195270	I will wait here at the dock, but I will meet you at the <itemName> once you’ve got it set up. If you have any further questions please come and see me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_195270	I’m so glad you’ve made it here safe and I’m very excited to be working with you!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195272	Wow!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195272	<glee>Smell that fresh air!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195272	I'll tell you what, it feels good to finally be back on <IslandName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195272	Now, <PlayerName>, I’m going to need your help getting settled, okay?þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195272	<yes>I’ll give you this <itemName>. Take your time and find a good place for it. It’ll be our like our town hub!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_195272	Take this map as well. If you have any questions, please just ask me.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_195272	<shy>I haven’t been back to <IslandName> for a very long time, but I think I can still be helpful.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_195272	<yes>I’ll be waiting by this dock until you set up the <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_195272	<yes>So if you get lost, just check your map to find the dock again.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_009_195272	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195274	<shy>I’ve got another job for you, <PlayerName>.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195274	 You up for it?
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_000_195274	I'm ready!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_001_195274	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Option_002_195274	Not yet.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_000_195274	I'll tell you what, I think camping is fun!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_001_195274	<yes>But if we’re going convince people to stay here on <IslandName> we’ve gotta start building more permanent structures.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_002_195274	<thinking>I’ve noticed there is a lot of <itemName> on this island. I’ve seen it popping out of rocks all over the place.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_003_195274	<proud>I know a way we can melt down <itemName> into stuff great for building.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_004_195274	Now, I'll need you to bring me some items.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_005_195274	We'll need <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_006_195274	Keep in mind, you will need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore and rocks.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_000_007_195274	<proud>Once you’ve gathered everything we need, come and see me!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_001_000_195274	Let's have a look then.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_000_195274	<yes>Righto.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_001_195274	You've been helping out a lot, so take your time, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Response_002_002_195274	<glee>Just come back and see me when you're ready.
Generic/PlaceKennelRequest_Intro_000_195276	Hey <PlayerName>. Want a pet dog?
Generic/PlaceKennelRequest_Intro_001_195276	<yes>If you do place this <itemName> somewhere and come and speak to me.
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195278	Oh <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195278	Our town is really growing!
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195278	Someone has let me know they are interesting in living here.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195278	There is a new deed for a home avaliable. <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_195278	Once their home is build I'm sure they will move in! <glee>
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195280	Oh, <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195280	The towns ecconomy is growing very nicely.
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195280	I think it might be a good time for us to think about maybe building a bank.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195280	Please speak to me if you are interested in applying for a bank deed! <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195282	Oh <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195282	Our town is really growing!
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195282	Someone has let me know they are interesting in living here.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195282	There is a new deed for a home avaliable. <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_195282	Once their home is build I'm sure they will move in! <glee>
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_000_195284	Hey <PlayerName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_001_195284	I've had an idea for something <IslandName> could really use!
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_002_195284	Take this <itemName>.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_003_195284	<proud>I thought people could maybe put things they don't want in here.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_004_195284	<yes>I will clear it out on Thursdays.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_005_195284	<shocked>What am I doing with the stuff?
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_006_195284	<shy>I'm going to recycle it...
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_007_195284	<glee>Anyway, if you could place it down somewhere, that would be great.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_008_195284	<yes>Be sure to check it every so often.
Generic/BuilldTownOfficeRequest_Intro_009_195284	<yes>Anything you find in it is up for grabs, so feel free to take it!
Generic/Intro_Intro_000_195286	Oh <PlayerName>!
Generic/Intro_Intro_001_195286	Our town is really growing!
Generic/Intro_Intro_002_195286	Someone has let me know they are interesting in living here.
Generic/Intro_Intro_003_195286	There is a new deed for a home avaliable. <yes>
Generic/Intro_Intro_004_195286	Once their home is build I'm sure they will move in! <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195288	<PlayerName>! I received a letter earlier today from someone named <NPCName>. Unusual name, if you ask me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195288	Now I’ve heard of this fella. He’s a travelling trader. More than that, he’s a bloody legend.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195288	Rumour is that his parents acquired him by trading a set of antique cutlery!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195288	Trading is in his very blood!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195288	Well, he’s heard about all the hard work we’re doing putting this town together, and he reckons he wants to bring his little travelling store right here.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_195288	Opportunity is knocking, so let’s answer that door with a smile. Let's clear out some more space somewhere for this <itemName>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_195288	That way, there will be a place for anyone visiting our island to stay.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_195288	<PlayerName>, take this <itemName> and place it somewhere you think would be a good place visitors can stay.þ
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195290	<shy>That journal means a lot to me.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195290	<shy>But I think my Dad would be glad someone like you is looking after it.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195290	<pumped>But, I have a challenge for you, <PlayerName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195290	<pumped>I want you to try and beat my Father’s milestones.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195290	<no>Some of these milestones are going to take a long time to complete, but there is no hurry.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_005_195290	<thinking>I’m also going to add daily tasks to the journal. These will be smaller milestones that should be easy to complete in just one day.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_006_195290	<proud>Now for the good part.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_007_195290	<glee>For every milestone you surpass, you’ll be rewarded with <PermitPoints>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_008_195290	<yes>I'll tell you what, you're going to want a lot of <PermitPoints> eventually.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_009_195290	<no>But we can talk more about that tomorrow.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_010_195290	<yes>For now, check out the journal.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_011_195290	<shocked>I think you’ll find that you’ve actually completed some of the milestones inside.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_012_195290	So be sure to claim them. <glee>
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_013_195290	<yes>Now, are you hungry? I am.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_014_195290	<haha>I think it's just about lunch time.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_015_195290	<glee>I’ve seen fruit growing around this island and that sounds tasty!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_016_195290	<yes>You go and find us some fruit and when you get back I will show you how to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_000_195292	Oh, <PlayerName>. I almost forgot!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_001_195292	I noticed <NPCName> is selling a <itemName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_002_195292	That’s a tool I think will be very handy, indeed!
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_003_195292	I think we should try and make enough money to buy a <itemName> from <NPCName>.
Generic/IntroToQuest_Intro_004_195292	Here is my half of the Dinks. The rest is up to you! 
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_000_195294	<yes><PlayerName>, I see you have been repairing the Tele-Towers around the island.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_001_195294	<thinking>To be honest, I did not think you had the know-how to even understand what they were intended for…
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_002_195294	<yes>Regardless, I have come up with an idea to build a <itemName> that we could place wherever we want.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_003_195294	<thinking>Now adding too many would most likely disrupt the Tele-Network.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_004_195294	<yes>So I think we will only be able to build one.
Generic/BuildTeleporterRequest_Intro_005_195294	I have spoken to <NPCName> and she has agreed to add it to the available deeds.
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_000_195858	Wait! It looks like we're already working on your house!
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_001_195858	Make sure you place all the items needed for costruction into the construction box infront of your house.
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_002_195858	As soon as construction is completed, we'll see what we can do to make your house bigger. <glee>
Npc6/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_000_196342	Very good!
Npc6/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_001_196342	...Oh. It seems like you a bit short on cash. <shy>
Npc6/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_002_196342	Perhaps you can come back when your pockets are a bit heavier?
Npc9/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_000_197050	Oh, that's an empty frame.
Npc9/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_001_197050	<glee>We actually encourage locals to donate their own photos to display here!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197290	We've done some good work today, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_197290	Take the rest of the day off! 
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002_197290	<yes>We've got more work to do tomorrow!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197290	Crafting a fire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197290	Cooking at a fire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_197290	Bug hunting?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_197290	Sleeping?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_004_197290	I'm on it!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197290	Feel free to use the <itemName> in the Base Tent whenever you want.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197290	I'll tell you what, I'm sure you'll learn how to craft lots of useful things here on <IslandName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197290	Once you've got your <itemName> going, just put the item you want to cook into your hands.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197290	<yes>Then all that's left to do it pop it on and wait!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002_197290	<thinking>You'll want to eat a lot of food to keep your energy up!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000_197290	There are a lot of bugs found only here on <IslandName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_197290	<yes>Everytime you catch a new one it will be added to your Pedia. 
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002_197290	Maybe you could challenge yourself to find them all?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_197290	<haha>If you're ready for tomorrow, then sleeping will definetly bring tomorrow here faster!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_001_197290	Just pop your <itemName> down on the floor.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_002_197290	<yes>Wherever is fine, really.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_003_197290	<no>If you want to sleep under the stars, I'm not going to stop you.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_004_000_197290	Thanks again for your help, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197292	Hi there, <PlayerName>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_197292	Have you managed to get a <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197292	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197292	How do I craft a Furnace?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_197292	How do I make a Tin Bar?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_197292	I'm on it.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197292	Alright then...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197292	You can craft the <itemName> at the Crafting Table in the Base Tent.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197292	You should have everything you need!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000_197292	Once you've got your furnace, place it somewhere outside.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_197292	Then, all you have to do then is hold the <itemName> in your hands and pop it in!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002_197292	<haha>Oh, and you'll have to wait a bit!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_197292	No worries, <PlayerName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_001_197292	Just be sure to bring me the <itemName> once you have it!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197294	Ah, <PlayerName> what do you think of the <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_197294	I got it all set up fairly quickly, right! <haha>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_002_197294	How’d you go setting up yours?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197294	How do I place the tent?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197294	I haven't set up yet.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197294	It's actually the same way you set up the Base Tent!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197294	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.þ
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_197294	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>þ
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_197294	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_197294	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197294	Come back and speak to me once you've got your <itemName> all set up.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197296	Ah, <PlayerName>. Hows it going, mate? Do you have any questions?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197296	Tell me about the Island.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197296	Where do you think we should set up camp?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_197296	How do I place the tent?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_197296	See ya!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197296	<thinking>You see, I was actually born here on <IslandName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197296	<no>Back before we moved to  <SouthCity>...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_197296	<thinking>Hmmm...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_197296	Oh, right. Let me tell you what I remember about <IslandName>...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_197296	If I remember correctly, up north you'll find a tropical climate.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_005_197296	<thinking>To the south it can get a bit chilly, but I recall my Dad warned me about the wildlife down there…
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_006_197296	To the east and west of the island are flat open plains. The ground is nice and flat, so it would be easy to build there.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_007_197296	The coasts are a great place for fishing year-round. So if you like throwing a line, it might be worth setting up the <itemName> near the beach.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_008_197296	<haha>The centre of the island is a desert. It’s hot and dry there, and it’s full of bugs!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_009_197296	<yes>But no matter where you decide we should build, being close to water is always a good idea. 
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_010_197296	So if you want to set up inland anywhere, try and do it close to a river.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_011_197296	<haha>I feel like that’s a lot to take in. Sorry about that, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197296	It’s been a long time since I was here last! I was a little girl back then, so I’ll let you figure out how long ago that was! <shy>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197296	But I do have two places in mind that might be a good place to set up the <itemName>... <thinking>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002_197296	The eastern and western coasts both have plainlands that I think would make for an easy building area. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_003_197296	The terrain there is flat and won't take too much effort to build on. Plus the climate should be good for farming most of the year. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_004_197296	But you don’t have to listen to old <myName>!  You’re the one running around out there!þ
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_005_197296	I’m sure that wherever you decide to place the <itemName>, it will be the right place.<yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_006_197296	Now if you have any other questions, just ask!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000_197296	Ah, good question <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_197296	First select the <itemName> in your toolbelt so it’s in your hand.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002_197296	Once you use the <itemName> you’re going to have to decide where to place it.<yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003_197296	You’re going to need enough space for the <itemName> to be set up. The only other thing to keep in mind is that the ground needs to be flat and even. <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_004_197296	If you have any other questions, please come and ask me <yes>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_197296	Good luck, <PlayerName>!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197298	<PlayerName>! How is the search going?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_197298	Have you found all those items we need?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197298	What do I need again?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197298	Where can I get a campfire?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_197298	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_197298	I'm still looking.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197298	We need <questRequiredItems>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197298	I’ve seen <itemName> here and there on the island. It's a dark ore poking out of rocks.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_197298	Your going to need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect ore.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197298	You're going to need to craft a <itemName> at the crafting table in the Base Tent.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197298	Oh! And Your going to need a <MiningLicence> to buy a pickaxe to collect the stone to craft the <itemName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000_197298	Let's have a look...
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_197298	All right, mate. Keep your eyes peeled!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197300	<PlayerName>! Have you found a place for the <itemName>?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197300	How do I place the deed?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197300	I'm still looking.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197300	Just select the <itemName> from your toolbelt. Just like you did with the tents.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197300	Oh and make sure that the ground is nice and flat or you won't be able to place it.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197300	All good, mate. Be sure to come back here once you’ve placed the <itemName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197302	<PlayerName>. How goes the tucker hunting?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197302	Where can I find fruit?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197302	Not yet.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197302	I did see some fruit trees growing inland a bit on our ride over <IslandName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_001_197302	It usually grows on smaller trees and shrubs.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_002_197302	Just try shaking any tree you you can!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_003_197302	If I remember correctly there are different fruits all over the island.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_004_197302	Good luck mate, looking forward to it! <glee>
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197302	That's okay!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197302	<haha>Old <myName> will be waiting here for you!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_000_197304	How goes the money making, <PlayerName>.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Intro_001_197304	Have you earned enough to buy that <itemName> we need?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_000_197304	I want to apply for a licence.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_001_197304	How do I make money?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_002_197304	How do I get permit points?
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Option_003_197304	Still a bit to go.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_000_000_197304	Okay, here you go.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_000_197304	<NPCName> will buy pretty much anything from you.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_001_197304	He will most of the things you can find around the island. Fruit, rocks, wood and all sorts of things.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_002_197304	<no>Now, you don't have to buy the <itemName> right away.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_001_003_197304	<haha>Feel free to buy any tools you think might make you money even quicker!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_000_197304	You can get <PermitPoints> by completing the daily tasks in your journal.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_001_197304	<yes>You'll also get a big lump of points by beating one of my Dad's milestones.
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_002_197304	<proud>My Dad did a lot of different things, so you'll find there are milestones for everything!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_002_003_197304	If you just go about your day doing your activites, I'm sure you'll get rewarded eventually!
Generic/TalkToWhileNotComplete_Response_003_000_197304	Keep it up, we're well on our way of making <IslandName> even better!
Npc9/AllItemsAlreadyDonated_Intro_000_197370	Oh my! It seems our museum has a <donationName> on exhibit already!
Npc9/AllItemsAlreadyDonated_Intro_001_197370	I'll just return this to you.
Npc9/NonLocalPicture_Intro_000_197454	Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!
Npc9/NonLocalPicture_Intro_001_197454	<getPhotoDetails>
Npc9/NonLocalPicture_Intro_002_197454	The photographer is very talented!
Npc6/Already Being UpgradedTent_Intro_000_201124	Wait! It looks like we're already working on your house!
Npc6/Already Being UpgradedTent_Intro_001_201124	Make sure you place all the items needed for costruction into the construction box infront of your tent.
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_000_201664	Wait! It looks like we're already working on your house!
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_001_201664	Make sure you place all the items needed for costruction into the construction box infront of your house.
Npc6/Already Being Upgraded_Intro_002_201664	As soon as construction is completed, we'll see what we can do to make your house bigger. <glee>
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_000_201856	Hmmmm... The museum isn't really looking for this kind of thing.
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_001_201856	Our collection include, fish, bugs and relics. If there are any other items you don't want, maybe consider selling them?
Npc9/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_002_201856	Thanks!
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Intro_000_201968	Is there anything else I can do for you?
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Option_000_201968	How's the town?
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Option_001_201968	About my House...
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Option_002_201968	Let's chat.
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Option_003_201968	No thanks.
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Response_000_000_201968	Ah! Very good!
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Response_001_000_201968	Let's see...
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Response_002_000_201968	Let's take a look.
Npc6/AskAgainConvo_Response_004_000_201968	Have a great day.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_000_202284	<glee>Oh, and thanks for placing the <itemName>.
Generic/BuildTownOfficeComplete_Intro_001_202284	You're a good friend, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_202286	Ah, goodmorning <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_202286	Did you happen to see that <NPCName> has set up his tent at the Visitor's Site?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202286	<yes>I told him all about you and how you’ve helped us get started here.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202286	<haha>He sounded impressed!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202286	John trades all sorts of things back to <SouthCity>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202286	I reckon nearly anything you can find on this island will be valuable to him.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202286	He’ll buy fruit, fish, bugs and even rocks! <yes>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202286	<NPCName> also sells a lot of useful tools.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_202286	He’s got mining equipment, logging tools and even some fishing equipment.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_009_202286	<thinking>Although, probably can't sell you a lot of tools until you have all your <Licences> in order.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_010_202286	You know about <Licences>, right?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_202286	No I don’t.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_202286	Yes I do.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_202286	<Licences> are an old <SouthCity> idea!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_202286	I’ll tell you what, you didn’t need a <Licence> for anything back when I was growing up!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_202286	<no>But these days, you need a <Licence> for everything.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_202286	Luckily I’m actually an accredited <Licence> Giver! <proud>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_202286	If you want to apply for a <Licence> come and talk to me. <yes>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_005_202286	You’ll have to spend some <PermitPoints> to get them, but if you keep doing milestones you’ll make enough in no time.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_006_202286	As you get better at doing certain tasks, new <Licence> levels will open up too.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_007_202286	Now, let’s see if there is a <Licence> you can apply for right now...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_202286	That's great!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_001_202286	I’ll tell you what, you didn’t need a <Licence> for anything back when I was growing up!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_002_202286	<no>But these days, you need a <Licence> for everything.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_003_202286	Luckily I’m actually an accredited <Licence> Giver! <proud>
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_004_202286	If you want to apply for a <Licence> come and talk to me. <yes>

Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_006_202286	As you get better at doing certain tasks, new <Licence> levels will open up too.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_007_202286	Now, let’s see if there is a <Licence> you can apply for right now...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_202288	<glee>Well done, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_202288	<yes>You have proven yourself invaluable once again!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202288	<shocked>You're really starting to carry a lot of stuff around!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202288	<yes>I'll tell you what, I'll teach you how to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202288	<yes>You're going to need a recipe for Nails too.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202288	<proud>I'll tell you what, <IslandName> is well on it's way to being a great settlement again!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202288	<yes>With a furnace and a table saw we can start thinking about building more permanent structures.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202288	I'll tell you what, we should try and get <NPCName> to set up a real shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_202288	Let's do it!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_202288	How do we do that?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_202288	That's the spirit, <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_202288	<yes>I reckon if we spend a bit of money at his tent, he'll see it's worth while...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_202288	<yes>Oh, and we should show him how friendly people are around here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_202288	Why don't you ask <NPCName> if he has anything he needs done?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_202288	<haha>If we can prove to him that <IslandName> is a great place to move, I'm sure he'll ask to live here for good!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_202288	<thinking>Hmmmm....
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_001_202288	<yes>I reckon if we spend a bit of money at his shop, he'll see it's worth while...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_002_202288	<yes>Oh, and we should show him how friendly people are around here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_003_202288	Why don't you ask <NPCName> if he has anything he needs done?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_004_202288	<haha>If we can prove to him that <IslandName> is a great place to move, I'm sure he'll ask to live here for good!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_000_202290	You found a good place for your tent?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_202290	<shy>I know it's not much, but I hope you like your new home!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202290	I'll tell you what, you've got the "spark", <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202290	<yes>You see, most people back in <SouthCity> are scared of leaving.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202290	<thinking>There is something about that place that pulls the "spark" out of people...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202290	<no>But I'll tell you what, we certainly aren't the first to leave!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202290	Have you ever heard of the traveling trader, <NPCName>?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_000_202290	No I haven't.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Option_001_202290	Of course I have!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_000_202290	<yes>I'll tell you what, he’s a bloody legend!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_001_202290	Rumour is that his parents acquired him by trading a set of antique cutlery!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_002_202290	<proud>Trading is in his very blood!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_003_202290	<NPCName> got in contact with me before we left <SouthCity>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_004_202290	<pumped>He's interested in visiting with his shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_005_202290	<no>I'll tell you what, we can't miss an opportunity like this!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_006_202290	<yes>I reckon we get this <itemName> ready for him.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_007_202290	<yes>That way we'll have a place ready for any visitors who come to <IslandName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_008_202290	I’ll let you decide where the best place for this <itemName> is.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_009_202290	<haha>Just be sure it's closeby!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_010_202290	<glee>We want visitors to feel like part of the <IslandName> community while they are here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_011_202290	Who knows, maybe we can convince him to set up a permanent shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_000_012_202290	<yes>Be sure to talk to me once you have placed the <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_000_202290	<haha>Who hasn't!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_001_202290	<pumped>He's a bloody legend!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_002_202290	<proud>Trading is in his very blood!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_003_202290	<NPCName> got in contact with me before we left <SouthCity>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_004_202290	<pumped>He's interested in visiting with his shop here!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_005_202290	<no>I'll tell you what, we can't miss an opportunity like this!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Response_001_006_202290	<yes>I reckon we get this <itemName> ready for him.

Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202294	<shy>I know it's not much but it will be a place you can call home!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202294	Now, there is plenty of room to spread out here on <IslandName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202294	So please take your time to place your <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202294	<yes>You’ll probably be visiting the Base Tent a fair bit.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_202294	<thinking>So keep that in mind while you are looking for a spot to claim as your own.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_009_202294	I’ll be inside the Base Tent getting things ready. 
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_010_202294	Come and speak to me once you’ve placed your <itemName>.

Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202296	Here is a recipe for a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202296	Now why don't you try crafting the <itemName> at the crafting table in the base tent?þ
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202296	<yes>Once you've crafted the <itemName>, pop it on the ground outside somewhere.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202296	Then, just place the ore inside of it.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202296	It will take a little while to do its thing, so feel free to do some other activities while it's melting.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202296	Bring me the Tin Bar when you're ready, okay?
Generic/AcceptDog_Intro_000_202298	Oh, so you placed the <itemName>?

Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202302	<yes>You remind me of my father. He was born right here on <IslandName>, you know?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202302	<proud>He was a true blue Adventurer through and through.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202302	He loved doing new things and keeping track of all his milestones in his <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202302	<sigh>I wanted to come here and try and meet those milestones myself.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202302	<no>But I’m getting a bit long in the tooth, <PlayerName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_202302	<shy>Please, I want you to take his <itemName>.

Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_202304	<yes>Eating food will help keep your energy up!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202304	Here is the recipe for a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202304	I found these stones earlier so you can use these to craft your <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202304	<shy>You'll have to find some wood yourself though.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202304	Feel free to use the crafting table in the Base Tent to craft a <itemName>.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202304	Take your time, <PlayerName>.

Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_001_202306	Well done, <PlayerName>!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_002_202306	Don't you think having <NPCName> here is great?
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_003_202306	<thinking>If only we could  convince <NPCName> to move here permanently...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_004_202306	<thinking>Hmmmm...
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_005_202306	<haha>Well, let's worry about getting the materials needed for a permanent building first!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_006_202306	The <itemName> is a great first step!
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_007_202306	For now, you can have a break.
Generic/CompleteQuest_Intro_008_202306	<yes>Come back and talk to me when you are ready.
Npc6/No House_Intro_000_202934	But you don't have a house yet! If you ask my about deeds we might be able to solve that.
